# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 👋

This repository is a personal project where I document and practice various Python programming concepts. It is part of my ongoing journey through the **Microsoft Learning Path for Python**. Here, you'll find code examples, exercises, and projects that reflect my progress and understanding of Python.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- **Learning Exercises**: Code snippets and solutions for different exercises covering basic to advanced Python topics.
- **Project Implementations**: Small projects and scripts that demonstrate practical applications of the concepts I’m learning.
- **Experimentation**: Code where I explore new libraries, tools, and programming techniques.
- **Refactoring and Optimization**: Improved versions of earlier code to enhance readability, performance, and adherence to best practices.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Python basics (loops, functions, data structures)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- File handling and exceptions
- Python standard library modules like `math`, `random`, and `os`

## 🔍 What's Next?

- Dive deeper into Python’s standard library and its advanced features
- Explore popular Python libraries and frameworks such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Flask`
- Build more complex projects to apply and solidify my learning

## 🤝 Contributing

## Space application example 
To utalize all learnings so far. I have started to build a space application to test and improve durig my python learning journey..
🚀 Space App
Space App is a Python-based application designed to explore the mysteries of space through various features such as planetary information, star charts, space missions, and more. It allows users to interact with a rich database of celestial objects and track real-time space events. 🌌

2. Features
This section will give a brief description of the core functionalities of your space app. You want to summarize what the app can do for users.

Example:
Features
🌍 Planetary Information: Get detailed information about planets in our solar system.
🌌 Star Charts: View interactive star maps, constellations, and galaxies.
🚀 Space Missions: Track past, present, and future space missions.
🛰 Real-Time Space Events: Stay updated on astronomical events like eclipses, meteor showers, and planetary transits.
🔭 Telescope Mode: Explore the stars as if you were looking through a telescope.

Thank you for visiting my repository and joining me on this learning journey!
